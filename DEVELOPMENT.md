# Local Setup
Clone the repo locally and install all of the node modules. You then need to make your own `config/config.json` file for your database settings. 

To have Sequelize-CLI do this for you, run the following from your terminal:

```bash
sequelize init:config
```

Next, make sure you have created a `pet_facebook` database, and that your connection settings are correct.
