# Petster
What's the worst part about social media? The people.

That's why we started **[Petster](https://thepetbook.herokuapp.com/)**, a place where we can all talk about and show the things we care most about, out pets.

## Features
Using Petster, you can create a profile and add all of your pets. You can also upload photos for those pets and your profile. There's even a feed section for sending messages out into the world for the rest of the Petster community to enjoy.
